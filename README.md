# NN_PersonDetection
In this project, we designed a neural network using Keras and Tensorflow 2.0 in order to detect people in images from the RAISE dataset.

This project was done in collaboration with Do Dinh Tan Nguyen (Github: @Iketan18) in the course of a semester project at RWTH Aachen University.
